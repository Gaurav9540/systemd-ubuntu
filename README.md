**Run java jar file in background using Systemd**

üß© **What is systemd ?**

systemd is the system and service manager used by modern Linux distributions ‚Äî including Ubuntu (from version 15.04 onward).

It is the first process (PID 1) that runs when the system boots and is responsible for:

 - Starting and stopping all other system services
 - Managing dependencies between services
 - Handling system startup and shutdown
 - Logging (via journald)
 - Mounting filesystems
 - Managing targets (runlevels)
 - Think of systemd as the ‚Äúbrain‚Äù of your Linux system startup and service management.

‚öôÔ∏è **Key Features of systemd**

 -  **Service Management** - Controls all background services (systemctl start/stop/status)  <br>
 - **Parallel Boot** - Starts multiple services at once for faster boot times  <br>
 - **Dependency Handling** - Ensures services start in the correct order  <br>
 - **Logging (journald)** - Centralized system logging  <br>
 - **Targets (like runlevels)** - Define system states (e.g., multi-user.target, graphical.target)  <br>
 - **Timers** - Replace cron jobs for scheduled tasks (.timer units)  <br>

**Step 1: Copy the JAR to /opt/myapp**

```ssh
mkdir -p /opt/myapp
```

```ssh
cp /root/license_app/target/JWT-with-Spring-Security-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar /opt/myapp/
```

<hr>

**Step 2: Create a systemd Service File**
Create a new service:

```ssh
vim /etc/systemd/system/myapp.service
```

Paste this:

```ssh
Paste this:
[Unit]
Description=License App Service
After=network.target

[Service]
User=root
WorkingDirectory=/opt/myapp
ExecStart=/usr/bin/java -jar /opt/myapp/JWT-with-Spring-Security-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --server.port=8086
SuccessExitStatus=143
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=10

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

<hr>

**Step 3: Enable and Start the Service**

```ssh
systemctl daemon-reload
```

```ssh
systemctl enable myapp.service
```

```ssh
systemctl start myapp.service
```

<hr>

**Step 4: Check Status and Logs**

```ssh
systemctl status myapp.service
```

<hr>

**Step 8: Confirm It‚Äôs Running on Port 8086**

```ssh
lsof -i :8086
```

<hr>

**Step 9: Check all running services on ubuntu**

```ssh
systemctl list-units --type=service --state=running
```
